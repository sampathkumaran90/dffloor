PROCEDURES FOR SEGMENTATION

1. Create an account in kaggle

2. Download the fashion images dataset (Fashion Product Images) - two variations available one with 60*80 dimensions(Fashion Product Images (small)) other 
with HD images (Fashion Product Images Dataset). The small is version is 550MB and the larger version is 15GB

3. Once you download the data, it also provide us with a styles.csv file. Using that csv you can ignore some of the products from the dataset 
just by parsing the csv and removing the images from the dataset using a python script (say you may not need pants, underwears, sarees, t-shirts, sporting goods etc..).
This refinement helps to make the dataset available for our purpose.

4. Once the refinement is done, you can use any of the image segmentation tools available in the market.

5. Once it is been annotated, you can use any of the segmentation algorithms like U-NET, MASK RCNN, DEEPLAB V3 etc.. for training

6. During the inference, we first run our segmentation inference, find the segmented image parts and then do cv2 processing to get the results
